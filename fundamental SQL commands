1. List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.

adding :  INSERT INTO ____ VALUES 

update : UPDATE ____ SET ____ WHERE 
	ALTER TABLE _____ ADD COLUMN

delete : DELETE FROM _____ WHERE 
	DROP TABLE _____


2. Explain the structure for each type of command.

The main categories are 
-DDL (Data Definition Language) is the part of SQL that allows a database user to create and restructure database objects, such as the creation or the deletion of a table.
ex: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE 

DML (Data Manipulation Language) used to manipulate data within objects of a relational database. 
ex: INSERT UPDATE DELETE

DQL (Data Query Language):  used to compose queries against a relational database. 
ex: SELECT

DCL (Data Control Language) allow you to control access to data within the database.
ex: ALTER PASSWORD GRANT REVOKE CREATE SYNONYM

Data administration commands : allow the user to perform audits and perform analyses on operations within the database
ex: START AUDIT STOP AUDIT 

Transactional control commands: allow the user to manage database transactions.
ex: COMMIT ROLLBACK SET TRANSACTION 


3. What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example of each type.

data types such as:  
	CHAR/VARCHAR could be used in lengthy string(an contain letters, numbers, and 		special characters) ISBN, reference code 
	TEXT - holds string with max length  of 65,535 characters - single/simple words/	phrase, such as names/addresses    
	LONGTEXT-holds strings with a max length of 4,294,967,295 characters- a 		description/longer texts 
	Time- A time. Format: HH:MI:SS 

4. Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. The table needs to have first and last names, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

 Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?
First and last name. - text 
Whether they sent in their RSVP.-boolean
Number of guests.- integer
Number of meals. -Numeric (p,s)
Write a command that creates the table to track the wedding dinner.
CREATE TABLE tables (
 	Firstname text,
	LastName text, 
	RVSP bit,
	guestNumber integer, 
	Mealnumber numeric (5,2)
); 



Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.
ALTER TABLE tables ADD COLUMN thankYouCard bit; 

You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.
ALTER TABLE tables DROP COLUMN Mealnumber; 

The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.
ALTER TABLE tables ADD COLUMN tableNumber integer; 

The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the table numbers from the database.
DROP TABLE tables; 





5.Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.
 CREATE TABLE library (
 	ISBN VARCHAR,
	title text, 
	author text,
	genre text, 
	publishingDate date, 
 	totalCopies integer,
	availableCopies integer
); 


Find three books and add their information to the table.

INSERT INTO library (ISBN, title, 	 author,genre,publishingDate,totalCopies,availableCopies)
   VALUES  
   (0684843285,'Becoming','Michelle Obama','inspirational ','2018-11-13/',10,3),
   (0684843286,'The Border','Don Winslow','fiction','2019-02-26',3,2),
   (0684843281,'Educated','Tara Westover','educational','2018-12-12',6,3);

Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies to 1 fewer.

   UPDATE library 
   SET availablecopies = availablecopies-1 
   WHERE title='Becoming' AND author ='Michelle Obama'	;

Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.
  
 DELETE FROM library WHERE isbn = 0684843281  AND title= 'Educated';



6.Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:


Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.
Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.
Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.

 CREATE TABLE spaceCrafts (
 	id integer,
	name text, 
	yearLaunched integer,
	countryOfOrigin text, 
 	orbitingBody text,
    active boolean,
   	distanceFromEarthmi integer,
   	Desciption text

); 

	INSERT INTO spaceCrafts (id, name,yearLaunched,countryOfOrigin,orbitingBody,active,distanceFromEarthmi,Desciption)
    VALUES
    (1234,'Juno',2011,'USA','Mars',true,1224652, 'Juno is a NASA space probe orbiting the planet Jupiter It was built by Lockheed Martin and is operated by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.'),

        (2345,'Dawn',2007,'USA','Ceres',true,56789,'Dawn is a retired space probe launched by NASA in September 2007.'),
   (4567,'Hiten',1990,'Japan','Moon',true,88904,'It was Japan  lunar probe, arobotic lunar probe.');

    DELETE FROM spaceCrafts WHERE id =2345;
    
    UPDATE spaceCrafts SET active = false WHERE id=1234; 


7. Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the id of the email chain it's in. Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

Add three new emails to the inbox.
You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.
You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating the crash, so you can come back and read it later.

 CREATE TABLE Email (
 	id integer,
	subjectLine text, 
	sender VARCHAR,
	acc boolean, 
 	body text,
    read boolean,
   	timeStamp timestamp,
   	EmailThreadingID  VARCHAR

); 

	INSERT INTO Email (id,
	subjectLine , 
	sender,
	acc, 
 	body,
    read,
   	timeStamp,
   	EmailThreadingID
)
    VALUES
    (1234,'Indeed','indeed.com',false,'12 new Anaylst jobs in San Francisco',false,
     '2013-03-13 19:06:00',45612456),
    (2345,'Revolve','Revolve.com',false,'Summer outfits',true,'2018-12-03 06:06:00',67898763),
    (4657,'Bloc','Bloc.com',false,'assignment  approval',true,'2019-01-03 12:06:00',56726782);


  DELETE FROM Email WHERE id =1234;
    
    UPDATE Email SET read = false WHERE id=4657;
